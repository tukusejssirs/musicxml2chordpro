=========

- -ns and --note-spelling args on separate lines (optional)
- add option to use German chord names (either short or long versions: Ami = Am = a; B = H)
- use the first chord as help in assigning key (e.g.: there are no sharps nor flats, therefore the key might be C major or a minor ... first chord in song is Am -> key = a minor)
- sort the measures, before processing (line 102: We should really sort them by attribute 'number'. ... src: https://github.com/ironss/musicxml2chordpro/blob/db451274da5e8ae4adc0c863a4dafc131f23c912/xml2pro.py#L102)

- add details from <credit page="1"> (page number might change; this might include the title of the score - which might not be inserted in `workTitle` var)
  - python: span = item.find("span", class_="modelYearSort")
- add language argument [for key: A major (en) = A dur (sk); A minor = A mol (sk)]
- alternatively (using UTF-8), use U+266D symbol: ♭
